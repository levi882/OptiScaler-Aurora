// Multi Frame Generation on Ada.
//
// nvngx_dlssg.dll gates MFG on the architecture id reported by the driver: 0x1b0 is Blackwell, Ada
// is below it. Two sites decide what a card is allowed to do, and both compare against that constant.
//
//   Advertise, the function that publishes DLSSG.MultiFrameCountMax:
//       mov   ebx, 0x1
//       mov   r8d, 0x3            the Blackwell count
//       cmp   edi, 0x1b0
//       cmovl r8d, ebx            below Blackwell the count becomes 1
//
//   Validate, the function that accepts or rejects a requested count:
//       cmp   eax, 0x1b0
//       jl    ada                 Ada takes this branch and accepts only 1
//       cmp   ebx, 0x3
//       jbe   accept
//
// Patched: the count immediates become 5, the cmovl becomes a nop, and the jl becomes two nops. The
// result is a maximum of five generated frames -- 6X -- on any architecture.
//
// Memory only. The file on disk carries an Authenticode signature and is left alone.
//
// A Streamline wrapper between the game and the snippet can carry a lower ceiling of its own. That
// one is raised where the count crosses slDLSSGGetState. Advertise and validate have no such
// boundary: nothing stands between sl.dlss_g.dll and nvngx_dlssg.dll to intercept.
//
// Ada also runs a different interpolation kernel: Kernel_EstimateIntermMvecsScatter reads three f32
// fields of its parameter block on sm_120 and one on sm_89, so every generated frame lands at the
// same point between the two real ones. The Blackwell image is retargeted in place to answer for Ada.
